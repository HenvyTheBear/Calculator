# Calculator

First when you compile the code you will see is "Enter an operator: " and there will be 4 operators to 
choose from

1. Addition 
2. Multiplication 
3. Subraction 
4. Division 

to access one of these operators you enter the digit (Eg: 1 for Addition, 2 for Multiplication)
and hit enter, it will say what operator you are in (Eg: if you are in addition it says "You are now in Addition"), 
just enter the first value and the second afterwards, it will say the result.
